    I am a freelance data analyst in the greater Burlington, Vermont area. I'm trained as a quantitative ecologist. What does that mean? To me it means that my past work leaned heavily on statistics, large datasets, and the tools necessary to unite the two. I specialize in R, and lately I've been going deep with Shiny. In that last five years I've built one monster shiny application and another half-dozen small ones. My first apps were fairly generic, but lately I've been improving the experience with small javascript and jquery enhancements.

    Sometimes I consider finding a 9-5 job, but I'm pretty happy building apps for clients. Most of my clients have the option of controlling access to the final apps. If you are interested in seeing some send me a message and I'll see which ones I can show you. My email address is just my github account id, @gmail.com.

    I put this site together for a couple of reasons. First, I'm an R enthusiast, and I enjoy sharing what I know and offering tips for solving problems in R. Second, I've been involved in a couple of projects (such as the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=monitoR">R package monitoR</a>) that I hope to showcase here. Last, but not least, I'm not a social media enthusiast so of course I need a platform to show off what I can do to prospective clients.

    I used to take a lot of photos and chase a lot of birds and take photos while chasing birds. I don't do that very often anymore, and have mostly lost touch with my best birding buddy, but I see myself doing it again someday. I really mastered the "bird on a stick" photo.
