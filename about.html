    I am a freelance data analyst in The greater Burlington, Vermont area. I'm trained as a quantitative ecologist. What does that mean? To me it means that my work leans heavily on statistics, large datasets, and the tools necessary to unite the two. I specialize in R, and lately I've been going deep with Shiny. In that last five years I've built one monster shiny application and another half-dozen small ones. My first apps were fairly generic, but lately I've been improving the experience with small javascript and jquery enhancements.

    Sometimes I consider finding a 9-5 job, but I'm pretty happy building apps for clients. Most of my apps are for clients, and they have the option of controlling access to them. If you are interested in seeing some send me a message and I'll see which ones I can show you. My email address is just my github account id, @gmail.com.
