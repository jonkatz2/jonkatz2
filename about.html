    I am a freelance data analyst in the greater Burlington, Vermont area. I'm trained as a quantitative ecologist. What does that mean? To me it means that my past work leaned heavily on statistics, large datasets, and the tools necessary to unite the two. I specialize in R, database design and interaction, and lately I've been going deep with Shiny, a package that lets me unite those two in a web application. I spent a large part of the last three years building a single monstrous shiny application, plus another half-dozen small ones. My first apps were fairly generic, but lately I've been improving the experience with small javascript and jquery enhancements.

    <p>
    Most of the apps I build are for specific uses by small groups. As such, my clients typically control access to the final apps. If you are interested in seeing one or two, send me a message and I'll show some to you. You can find my email address at the top of my resume.

    I put this site together for a couple of reasons. First, I'm an R enthusiast, and I enjoy sharing what I know and offering tips for solving problems in R. Second, I've been involved in a couple of projects (such as the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=monitoR">R package monitoR</a>) that I hope to showcase here. Last, but not least, I'm not a social media enthusiast so of course I need a platform to show off what I can do to prospective clients.

    I used to take a lot of photos and chase a lot of birds and take photos while chasing birds. I don't do that very often anymore, and have mostly lost touch with my best birding buddy, but I see myself doing it again someday. I really mastered the "bird on a stick" photo.

    <p>These photos are just a few I took  years ago. I put them here for fun.</p>
